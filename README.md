just learning how to code stoof

uh yeah so the webscraper2 basically scrapes through a wikipedia links, clicks on a random link, and then continue until it lands on the never gonna give up page on wikipedia
changes that i need to make:
- checking to see if the starting url is a wiki link
- maybe outputting the links the scrapper goes thro into a file so that its easier to read
far far future 
- using machine learning to predict the best links to click on which will get to the page
